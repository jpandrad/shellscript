# shellscript

`PerfLoad.sh` => I created this script to populate a New NGINX Cache service. Basically I get a list of all requested content on the server and request a new server. I Used to migrated VOD Cache Server to another cloud.

`SimpleCheckDownload.sh` => I created this script to monitor the latency time for downloading a BBVOD Content.
